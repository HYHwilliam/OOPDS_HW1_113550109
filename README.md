## About Handling invalid user input:
1. Input Validation:
   - Ensures that user inputs match the expected format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD for dates).
   - Restricts menu selection to valid options (e.g., out-of-range number).

2. Will Displays clear error messages when user inputs are invalid, to let user understand what mistake they made.

3. Retry Mechanism:
   - Retry: Clears the input and lets users re-enter valid data without crashing the program.
